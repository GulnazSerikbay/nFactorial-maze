Project Name: ExploreMaze!


Description: This is an interactive python game which generates a random maze and allows the user to navigate a sprite to the maze exit. However, the user can only view 9 cells at time, forcing them to explore various different paths to identify the exit. The exit is always denoted by a yellow dot on the maze mini map, while the user’s position is shown by a red dot.
Navigation is performed using the arrow keys, while the mini map can be toggled with the ‘v’ key. Additionally, the user can end the game and return to the home screen with the ‘h’ key.


Required libraries: This game makes use of the pygame library and a wrapper of the openCV library, ImageWriter.
To install these libraries, open command prompt (or terminal in MacOS) and run the following two commands:

pip install pygame

pip install opencv-python


Running the game: To run the game, open mazeGame.py in a python editor and run the file. All other required imports and images have been included in the zip folder.


Shortcuts: While there are no explicit shortcuts programmed into the game, when testing it is highly recommended to open the generated maze image in the file location ‘main maze/maze.jpg’ to be able to easily discern the maze solution.\
